The Params::Validate module provides a flexible system for validation
method/function call parameters.  The validation can be as simple as
checking for the presence of required parameters or as complex as
validating object classes (via isa) or capabilities (via can),
checking parameter types, and using customized callbacks to ensure
data integrity.

The module has been designed to work equally well with positional or
named parameters (via a hash or hash reference).

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

BUGS/ISSUES

Trying to run the test suite with Perl 5.6.0 on my machine caused
repeated core dumps, though 5.00405 and 5.00503 were both fine.  In
addition, 5.6.1-trial1 did not core dump so I can only presume that
the problem is Perl's, not this module's.  I do not know if the
problem is caused by the test code or the module itself.
