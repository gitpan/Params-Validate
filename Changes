- Added Attribute::Params::Validate - do validation via attributes!

- Rename set_options to validation_options.  This can now be exported
safely and is included in the :all export tag.  set_options is
deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  Thanks to Jon
Swartz for the suggestion.

- make sure all error messages contain the name of the subroutine that
was called.

- the error message given when an argument doesn't match the 'isa'
spec has been improved.

- use Carp::confess by default when dying with an error.  This
produces a more useful error message.
